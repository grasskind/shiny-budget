### **Plot**

The barplot on the left shows your spending for the current month. The points
above each bar show what your budget is for that category. The number tells you
how much is left to spend (it'll go negative if you exceed the budget). 

### **Budget Table**

On the right is a table showing the amount currently budgeted for each 
category. You can edit these amounts by double clicking on the numbers. You can 
also add or remove categories using the menus at the bottom. Adding a category 
that's already in the budget simply replaces the budgeted amount with the new value

Uploading a new budget will replace the current one. Don't worry if your uploaded 
budget is incomplete; any category that you've spent on this month will automatically 
be kept (although its budget will be reset to 0). Likewise, if you add a new item
that isn't accounted for in the budget, it'll be added with a budget of 0. 

#### **NOTE:** 
If you delete a category that you spent on this month it won't show up in the
plot. The budget is meant to keep track of all your spending, so I'd 
recommend not doing this. You can still see the missing items in the
**Month Total** plot on the dashboard page though.
