### **Category** 

Category can be chosen from the ones in your budget (**Select From Budget**) or 
from the ones in the expense table (**Select Existing**). Alternatively, you can
create a new category (**Create New**). 

### **Description**

Optional field, it's fine to leave this one blank

### **Date**

I would suggest using the GUI for this one rather than typing it out. Sometimes
it interprets typed dates weirdly.
