### **Shiny Budget**

Hi! Thanks for trying out my budgeting app. The goal of this program is to give
you a simple way to keep track of your spending. It also helps you create 
(and hopefully stick to) a monthly budget. Here's a brief overview of the app:

#### **Spending Tracker** 

Every YouTube video/blog post on budgeting preaches the importance 
of keeping track of your spending. That's the goal of this page. The **Average Spending** 
plot on the left shows your average monthly spending per category in the 
selected year. **Month Total** shows your total spending in the chosen month/year. 
The final plot, **Over Time**, shows the amount spent on a category of interest 
in a given year. 

At the bottom of the page you'll find the **Expense Table**. This is a searchable
database of your purchases. Items can be removed by clicking on them and then
pressing the **Delete Selected Rows** button below the table. The entire table can
be downloaded in **xlsx** format by pressing the **Download Table** button.  

#### **Budget**

This page contains an editable budget as well as a plot of how your spending in
each category compares to your budget for the month. More details in the 
corresponding help page. 

#### **Adding Data**

There are two ways to add new data to the app. To add one item at a time, use 
the **New Purchase** tab. To upload data in bulk, or to upload a budget,
use the **Upload Data** tab. 

#### **Tip**

You can close this page by clicking anywhere outside of the box or by pressing **Esc**.
