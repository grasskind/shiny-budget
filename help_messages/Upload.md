### **Spending Tracker**

File should be in **xlsx** format. If your spreadsheet has multiple sheets,
select the appropriate one, **then** click the browse button (order matters, 
since it'll upload sheet 1 by default). If you'd like to upload multiple sheets,
you don't need to browse multiple times. Just switch the sheet number and it'll
upload automatically. A preview of your upload will be displayed on the right so
you can check that your upload worked correctly. The data does need to be formatted
with columns in a certain order, so a downloadable template is provided.

#### **Date System**

Early versions of Excel for Mac store dates differently, so if you're using Excel
2008 for Mac or below, select **1904 (Mac)**. For more information, see this

### **Budget** 

Analagous to **Spending Tracker**. File should be in **xlsx** format and a template
is provided.
